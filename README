This is an open-source sentiment analysis tool for Hungarian language, written in Python.

I created a REST API for easier access.

Please use sentence tag for adding input like this {'sentence': '<write your input here>'}
Tool is accessable via a HTTP POST request at http://<ip_addr_of_docker>:5000/sentiment url

Usage example:
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{"sentence": "Budapest az egyik legszebb v√°ros."}" http://192.168.196.144:5000/sentiment

Installation (now under construction):
1. Native way
	- prerequisite: linux OS (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS)
	- launch ./install.sh
